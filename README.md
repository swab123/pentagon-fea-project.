# Structural Static & Transient Analysis Project

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains the complete analysis files, documentation, and images related to a structural simulation study. The goal of the project is to evaluate the structure's behavior under static and time-varying loads. The analysis includes:

- Static displacement evaluation  
- Transient response behavior  
- Stress concentration mapping  
- Convergence verification for numerical stability  
- Comparison between multiple load scenarios  

This project is ideal for academic submission, engineering documentation, or research demonstration.
